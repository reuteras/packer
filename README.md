# Packer

This repo contains scripts and configuration to build virtual machines on macOS and Windows with the help of packer and VMware. At the moment I don't have a macOS machine with an Intel processor so those scripts are not tested. Since VMware Fusion for arm is in beta no real effort is made to support that platform.

## Instructions on Windows

To get started install VMware Workstation, [packer][pai] and git. My recommendation is to install git with the command **winget**. Run the following in a Windows Terminal:

    winget install Git.Git

You have to add *C:\Program Files\Git\bin* to the Path environment variable. Also make sure that you have VMware in the path, *C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation*.

Then start a new terminal and change to folder where you like to check out the repo. Then use git to check it out and configure some defaults.

    git clone https://github.com/reuteras/packer.git
    cd packer
    # Open and configure the default values
    <editor> defaults.ps1

To build a VM use **cd** to change to the folder for base image you would like to use. The following are available for Windows

- packer-centos
- packer-kali
- packer-ubuntu

### CentOS

- centos-7 - CentOS 7 - build with **./build-centos-7.ps1**
- centos-8-stream - CentOS 8 Stream - build with **./build-centos-8-stream.ps1**

### Kali

- kali - my repo [kali-tools][kat] is used to do a very basic installation of [Kali][kal] - build with **./build-kali.ps1**

### Images based on Ubuntu

Configuration for the images based on Ubuntu 20.04 is done in *variables-ubuntu-2004.pkr.hcl* for images based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Images based on Ubuntu 20.04.

- Ubuntu 20.04 default - build with **./build-ubuntu-2004.ps1**
- [REMnux][rem] installed via my repo [remnux-tools][ret] - build with **./build-remnux.ps1**
- [SIFT][sif] installed via my repo [remnux-tools][ret] - build with **./build-sift.ps1**

Configuration for the images based on Ubuntu 22.04 is done in *variables-ubuntu-2204.pkr.hcl* for images based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

Images based on Ubuntu 22.04.

- Ubuntu 22.04 default - build with **./build-ubuntu-2204.ps1**
