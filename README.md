# Packer

This repo contains scripts to build virtual machines on macOS with VMware Fusion and on Windows with VMware Workstation. At the moment I don't have a macOS machine with an Intel processor so those scripts are not tested.

## Instructions on Windows

Install VMware Workstation, [packer][pai] and git. My recommendation is to install git with the command **winget**. Run the following in a Windows Terminal:

    winget install Git.Git

You have to add *C:\Program Files\Git\bin* to the Path environment variable. 

Then start a new terminal and run:

    git clone https://github.com/reuteras/packer.git
    cd packer
    # Open and configure the default values
    <editor> defaults.ps1
